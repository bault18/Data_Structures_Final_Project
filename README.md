# Data_Structures_Final_Project
This project was the final for my Data Structures course in the fall of 2015.

We were to make a hospital simulator that ran through a week in a hospital.

The goals of the project were:

-Allow the user to enter in the number of doctors, nurses, and patient arrival rate (patients/hour)

-Simulate the hospital during the course of a week

-Calculate the average wait time of patients

-Keep data of all patients once the simulation ended


Our professor wanted us to focus on inheritance and polymorphism and required that we use at least one:

-set, map, and/or hash table

-queue or priority queue


Looking at the project now (1 year later) I think it might be worth it to go back and try to make it more efficient than it is
as we ended up implimenting a lot of unnessecary iterations.
